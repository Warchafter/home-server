# Vaultwarden - Password Manager
# =============================================================================
# A lightweight, self-hosted Bitwarden-compatible password manager written in
# Rust. Works with all official Bitwarden apps and browser extensions.
#
# SETUP:
#   1. Open http://SERVER_IP:8092 and create your account
#   2. IMPORTANT: After creating your account, set VAULTWARDEN_SIGNUPS_ALLOWED=false
#      in .env and run: docker compose up -d vaultwarden
#      This prevents anyone else from creating accounts on your server.
#
# HTTPS NOTE:
#   Vaultwarden works over HTTP on LAN, but Bitwarden mobile apps and browser
#   extensions prefer HTTPS. Options:
#   - Use Tailscale's MagicDNS HTTPS (easiest)
#   - Add a domain and enable HTTPS in Caddy (see docs/adding-a-domain.md)
#   - For local-only use, HTTP is fine
#
# Access at: http://SERVER_IP:8092 (routed through Caddy)
